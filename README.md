# What is Got2Go?  
Got2Go is an app for folks looking for a quality public restroom in their area. The app was inspired by parents, especially dads, who have a hard time finding a proper changing stations or a safe space to take their daughters to potty. Yet, we understand that finding a public bathroom in most big cities is difficult for a lot of people. We are starting with Austin as a use case and hope to expand this tool to include more major cities.

We have created an empty license.txt file for you. Well, actually, it says,
"<Replace this text with the license you've chosen for your project.>" We 
recommend you edit this and include text for license terms under which you're
making your code available. A good resource for open source licenses is the 
[Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/).


Finally, consider defining some sprints and work items in Track & Plan to give 
interested developers a sense of your cadence and upcoming enhancements.
